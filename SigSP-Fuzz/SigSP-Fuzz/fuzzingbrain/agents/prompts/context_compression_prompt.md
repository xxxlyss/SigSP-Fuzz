Compress tool results based on what the AGENT actually used.

## How to Decide What's Useful
Look at the AGENT's response after each tool result:
- If agent mentioned specific lines/functions → those are USEFUL
- If agent analyzed or reasoned about the result → keep that part
- If agent ignored the result or moved on → mark as [checked, not relevant]

## Messages to Compress
{messages_text}

## Output Format

Output ONLY compressed results. NO preamble.

For EACH tool call:

If agent USED it:
```
Tool: <tool_name>(<key_args>)
Signature: <function_signature>
Agent noted:
  - Line X: <code agent mentioned>
  - <agent's finding>
```

If agent IGNORED it:
```
Tool: <tool_name>(<key_args>)
[checked, not relevant]
```

## Rules
1. Keep what the AGENT referenced, not what YOU think is important
2. Preserve agent's exact reasoning and conclusions
3. For code: only lines the agent actually mentioned
4. Output compressed results directly - no summary, no preamble
