Worker Builder

Builds fuzzer with a specific sanitizer in the worker's workspace.
This is different from the Controller's build - each worker builds
its own copy with its assigned sanitizer.

Note: Coverage fuzzer is built once by Controller and shared by all Workers.
Workers access the shared coverage fuzzer via the coverage tool.
