POV Delta Strategy

Strategy for delta-scan mode: analyzes changes in diff for vulnerabilities.

Workflow:
1. Check if diff changes are reachable from fuzzer
2. Analyze reachable code to find suspicious points
3. Verify suspicious points with AI Agent (parallel pipeline)
4. Generate POV for high-confidence points (parallel pipeline)
5. Save results
